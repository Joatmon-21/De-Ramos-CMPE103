# De-Ramos-CMPE103
 
## Tic-Tac-Toe

### Planned Features:
- ![](https://progress-bar.dev/100/) Custom Character Selection
- ![](https://progress-bar.dev/40/) Custom Color Selection
- [ ] Add an option to play against the computer with varying difficulties:
  - ![](https://progress-bar.dev/0/) Easy - Randomizer
  - ![](https://progress-bar.dev/0/) Medium
  - ![](https://progress-bar.dev/0/) Hard - Minimax Algorithm

### Code Optimization Plans:
~~Change the tile list data type to char to reduce memory usage~~
> Apparently, using chars is similar to the function of ALT+NUM, or would refer the the unicode characters. This would make debugging a big hassle so the idea is scrapped.

- Try adding documentation
> It's a good thing to have so why not try? At least you can sleep tightly knowing you aren't affected by the memes mentioning no documentation on your code :sassy_man:
